# Introduction

In this presentation, we'll explore how to create slides using \*\*reveal.js\*\*, \*\*xaringan\*\*, and \*\*Jupyter Rise\*\*, and how to upload them to GitHub.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RMD and Quarto with Reveal.js

## Step 1: Create a Repository

[-]{.underline} Create a new GitHub repository or use an existing one (e.g., from your lab). [-]{.underline} Clone the repository locally using \*\*RStudio\*\* by creating a new \`.Rproj\` file.

## Step 2: Install Required Packages

Install the necessary packages in R:

\`\`\`r install.packages(c('xaringan', 'revealjs'))

## Rmarkdown with revealJS

This should give you this in this YAML header: 

```{YAML}
output: revealjs::revealjs_presentation
```

## Quarto with Revealjs

![](img/quarto.png)

This should give you this in this YAML header:

```{YAML}
format:
  revealjs:
    theme: night
```

## Rmarkdown with Xarrigan

The YAML header should be thsi:

```{YAML}
output: xaringan::moon_reader
```

# Uploading slides onto github. 

## Rename your files 
Name the qmd, or rmd file that you want to render on github as index.qmd or index.rmd. 

Render, which will create a html file. 

## Select directory to render slides on github    
Go to gihub and select setting in your project repository. 
Select pages, and select build and deploy from branch main and in root.

# Final step

## push your changes and you are done! 



Press H on xarrigan to see the short cuts and P is presenter notes. S in reveal.js is the presenter notes. 

# Jupyter notebook prsentation 

## Install jupyter rise

```{bash}
pip install jupyterlab_rise
```

## Create Jupyter notebook    
Open a new Jupyter notebook. Each code cell will serve as a slide in the presentation.
Add content, code, and markdown for each slide.

## Present

In Jupyter, click the presenter button (top-right corner) to switch to presentation mode using RISE.
